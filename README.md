Answer these questions:

What problem does the Observer pattern help solve?
- It resolves the problem of how to connect non-connected systems where data arrives from a source (and can arrive at random) and isn't available at startup. A good example is keyboard presses and typing on a website- you can't predict how the user will input keypresses.

How would you describe the Observer pattern?
- A source maintains a list of recievers- that it informs on any changes (or updates).

Where is polymorphism used in this pattern?
- Using interfaces and calls properly in code can allow one to easily expand (or write new functions) for existing code with minimal understanding. Polymorphism in this pattern means you can take the existing interfaces and implement their methods (for calling and receiving) for as many new sets of functions as needed. If this was non-polymorphic

Did the UML diagrams make the coding more straightforward?
- Uhh, kindof? It was missing a lot of things we had to implement, and was wrong in some locations. I guess it gave us a gist- but userstories would have been more helpful. (for us to implement)
